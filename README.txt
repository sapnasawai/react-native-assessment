In this file, please put a description of how your app works. The description should be at the right level of detail, so that someone familiar with React Native can read this file and understand what you've done.

1.I have installed the react-native-elements library.
2.Used Checkbox instead of RadioButton as this library doesn't support RadioButton.
and Made Checkbox looks like Radiobutton
3.Defined hardcoded data in separate file.
4.I have created separate components and files
5.Defined all the constants we are using in separate file, including the API for dynamic data
6.Called the API using fetch() method.
7.We will use the respective data based on which RadioButton selected
8.Created an input box which will take a country name and show the average and the blue bar.

At the end of this file, you must also include a comment indicating whether your app fully meets all the requirements given in the question, or whether it only works partially. If it is partial, then please give an indication of what works and what doesn't.
